Shaman
======

Shaman is a UI for distributed Erlang systems introspection.

Work in progress
----------------

The base of the project is there, but a lot remains to be done,
and a lot will still change over the coming weeks. Feel free to
try it, and even report bugs, but don't consider this anything
even remotely close to a finished project. Thank you.

Try it!
-------

First, start it:

``` bash
$ make && ./_rel/bin/shaman console
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your Websocket enabled browser.
